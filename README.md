# UnityStepSequencer
Simple javascript Step Sequencer for Unity 3D
Simply attach the BasicSequencer script to a game object add a short audio sample like a kick or a snare in the inspector and start the application.
Once the app starts make a pattern , click create loop and press play to hear.
--Known issues--
1-At the moment the create loop function will stop the audio if its playing.
2-Doesn't work in real time if you edit the sequence you will have to click create loop again and press play to hear.
This is just an crude example of a sample accurate step sequencer in Unity 3D using a sample.
